# Kisiel Logic
An inprovement on my old program with the same name (which now is privated)
## Changes
The main inprovement of this version is the use of polymorthism and abstraction. This makes it esier to add new gates and it dosnt require any changes to allready existing gates when new ones are added.
## How To Use
When the program opens it displays diferent options and sks you to select which one you would like to choose. The main confusion comes from the Connect option as it dosnt specify what order to enter the gates. The first gate you enter should be the gate that outputs and the second one the one that inputs.
