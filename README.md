# Kisiel Logic
An inprovement on my old program with the same name
## Changes
The main inprovement of this version is the use of polymorthism and abstraction. This makes it esier to add new gates and it dosnt require any changes to allready existing gates when new ones are added.
All in all this is just a lot better and makes the old version obsolete.
